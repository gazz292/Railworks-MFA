=============

Getting data out of railworks to display an MFA on a 2nd monitor

What i am using to display the trains driver info (speed, tractive effort, brake pressures, in-cab signaling and warning lights) on a 2nd monitor, so the train can be driven with the cab camera looking out the windscreen, and a monitor mounted behind the controller displaying the 'dash board'
